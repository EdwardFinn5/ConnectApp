It was founded in 1852 by Dutch immigrant Adrian Van Vliet to educate German-speaking ministers who could communicate with incoming immigrants. In 1902, new programs emerged to form what is now the University of Dubuque. Located in Iowa’s first city, Dubuque is home to the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium, the Dubuque Museum of Art, a variety of shops and restaurants, event venues, and more. The city of nearly 60,000 boasts miles of trails for walking, hiking, biking, and many Mississippi waterway and byway activities. Over the last 20 years, UD initiated a variety of initiatives to help increase enrollment, improve academic programs, and beautify the campus with contemporary building projects. Over the past 20 years, the University has invested over $250 million in new campus construction and renovations. During this period, UD’s enrollment has grown by over 400% with current student enrollment peaking to nearly 2,300. Representing 43 states and 22 countries, its student population puts UD on the map as one of the most diverse private colleges in Iowa.\r\n",
